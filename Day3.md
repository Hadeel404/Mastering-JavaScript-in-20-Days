## Lesson Summary

In this lesson, we explored mm in JavaScript. Here are the key points covered:

- mm is the process of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope.
- Variable declarations are hoisted but not their assignments. They are accessible but have an initial value of `undefined`.
- Function declarations are also hoisted, allowing them to be called before they are defined.
- Hoisting does not apply to function expressions, arrow functions, or variables declared with `let` or `const`.

## Coding Examples
