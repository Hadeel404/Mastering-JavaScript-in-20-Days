# Day 2: Static Typing and scope in javaScript.

This README file summarizes Static Typing & scope in javaScript . 

## Lesson Summary
Here are the key points covered:

### Static Typing
  TypeScript, Flow, and type-aware linting:
#### Benefits:
1. Catch type-related mistakes
2. Communicate type intent
3. Provide IDE feedback

**Static type** in typeScript means when assignning a variable to a value this variable will only hold data with this value's data type.

EX:
```javascript
var txt: string = "lol";
txt = {changeTXT:"nope"};  // Error: can`t assign object to string
```
#### TypeScript VS Flow :

### Scops: 
- units of scope in Js are : functions and blocks.
- shadowing: when two varibles have the same name but with different scopes.
